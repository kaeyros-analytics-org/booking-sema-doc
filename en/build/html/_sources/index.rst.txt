Welcome to Booking SEMA's documentation!
=========================================

Appointment Booking

Booking refers to all the actions required to book a service with a practitioner via the platform.
It involves a series of steps from collecting client information to confirming the appointment, including selecting the service, host, and time slot.
This process can be initiated by a user via the chatbot or by a receptionist from the management interface.
